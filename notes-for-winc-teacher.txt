  Some notes for the winc teacher:

  1) For the prisma setup I initially followed another guide so it didn't include the 'relationMode = "prisma"' line suggested for the datasource db object, as described in the assignment description. I ended up using onDelete: Cascade for related models. I know there are other options but that made the most sense to me.
  -> /prisma/schema.prisma

  2) Another difference from the course suggested code is with try catch blocks. I ended up finding a way to wrap the controller functions inside a asyncwrapper and it should catch any errors and push them to the errorHandler middleware. 
  -> /src/routes/
  -> /src/utils/asyncWrapper

  3) I also seperated controller functions and service functions for each endpoint as it made it easier for me to keep track of everything.
  -> /src/controllers/
  -> /src/services/

  4) I was a little confused about that there was no data included for what amenities each property should have or maybe I somehow missed that? I matched some amenities with properties in the prisma studio environment manually to test the properties query requirement of the assignment.

  5) For protected routes, in the course you would include the auth middleware on each route that you want to protect. I ended up flipping it and simply using the auth middleware on every route and then making exceptions for unprotected routes. In our case for '/login' and GET requests. 
  -> src\middleware\authMiddleware

  I hope this is all ok, if not I can change it. Thanks!
